# Awesome Generative Art

[![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> Manually curated collection of Generative Art languages, tools, educational, and other resources.

> The list is slightly (and subjectively) curated in that you'll find some resources in bold. If you're completely new to generative art, those resources are the "start here" links to help you learn and connect with other artists in this space. And, welcome! :grinning:
